To install, run a C++ compiler with minimum C++11 support to compile main.cpp, then run the produced binary. Assuming g++, run the following command: g++ main.cpp -O2 -o main

To run: .\main.exe

In the case that some middle output disappears in the terminal (Happened sometimes in vsc terminal), do output it out into a text file. That way the full output always comes out correctly. (Use .\main.exe > someTxtFile.txt)
